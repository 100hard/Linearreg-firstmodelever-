# Linearreg-firstmodelever-
Implemented my first model which is a simple linear reg model to get familiar with the whole pytorch thing
I created some fake data that follows a simple line equation (y = 0.7x + 0.3), split it into training and test sets, and then trained a tiny model to figure out that relationship. It uses PyTorch to handle the heavy lifting—like the math and optimization—and Matplotlib to make some neat plots so I could see how well it worked.
